# Credit Card Validator

This application will determine if the credit card number entered by the user is valid.

## Styling

The web application is styled using vanilla CSS and a mobile-first design approach has been used.

## System architecture

For this application I have used React + Vite as Vite is able to provide a quick and lean development environment.

The React + Vite template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

The application has been deployed using Netlify at the following URL: https://credit-card-validator01.netlify.app/
Netlify was chosen as it is easy to use and provides a free-tier for deployment.

## How to use the application

- A user will enter the credit card details.
- Upon clicking submit the application will inform the user that the credit card details or valid or if there are invalid details entered.
- The application is hosted at the following URL: https://credit-card-validator01.netlify.app/ , alternatively clone the code from the git repository and extract the files from the zip folder
- After opening the files in your code editor, run the "npm i" command to install dependencies
- To start the application run the "npm run dev" command.
